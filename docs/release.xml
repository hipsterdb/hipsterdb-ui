>Release Notes</title>

  <para
>   The release notes contain the significant changes in each
   <productname
>PostgreSQL</productname> release, with major features and migration
   issues listed at the top.  The release notes do not contain changes
   that affect only a few users or changes that are internal and therefore not
   user-visible.  For example, the optimizer is improved in almost every
   release, but the improvements are usually observed by users as simply
   faster queries.
  </para>

  <para
>   A complete list of changes for each release can be obtained by
   viewing the <link
linkend="git"
>Git</link> logs for each release.
   The <ulink
url="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-committers/"
><literal
>pgsql-committers</literal>
   email list</ulink> records all source code changes as well.  There is also
   a <ulink
url="http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb?p=postgresql.git;a=summary"
>web
   interface</ulink> that shows changes to specific files.
  </para>

  <para
>   The name appearing next to each item represents the major developer for
   that item.  Of course all changes involve community discussion and patch
   review, so each item is truly a community effort.
